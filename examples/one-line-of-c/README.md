# Music from One Line of C

Karl Yerkes / 2019-05-21

This uses the Tiny C Compiler (TCC) library (libtcc). On macOS, install with
`brew install libtcc`. On Windows, try `choco install tinycc`.

We use programs that we did not write. See:

- [Algorithmic symphonies from one line of code...]
- [One-line C programs that compose music...]
- [Some deep analysis of one-line music programs]
- [music written in the C programming language]

## TODO

This example still needs some work.

- Comment and clean the example code; it's still gross
- Show compile errors in a text box
  + does this require redirecting the stdout?
- Test on windows
- Visualize output as a texture
  + Rastrogram
  + Spectrogram
- Volume level control
- Time pointer (`t`) control
- Sample rate control
-
