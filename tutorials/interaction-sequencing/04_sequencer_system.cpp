 * This tutorial presents the facilities to sequence presets. This is useful

 * form the composition. This is done by connecting a PresetSequencer to a
 * PresetHandler.
 * In a later tutorial we will explore how to sequence event/voice based
 * systems. These systems offer polyphony and they will all have internal as
 * well as global parameters.

	We'll create a sequence file. This assumes that you have created
	at least three presets called 1,2 and 3 (You can create them with the
	earlier programs in this tutorial).

	Sequence files are stored in a simple plain text format. Each line
	corresponds to a command lo load a preset, with the preset name first,
	followed by the morph time and the wait time, separated by colons (without
	any spaces).

	The morph time in this case determines the time it takes to get to the
	preset and the wait time determines the time to wait after the morph has
	completed.

	For example, the sequence below sets preset "1" immediately (no morph time)
	and keeps it for 3 seconds. Then it takes 4 seconds to morph to preset "2".
	After these 4 seconds, there is a 2 second wait, after which it will take 1
	second to get to preset "3".

	The double colons ("::") mark the end of the sequence.
